# LeadIQ Pro: Smart CRM for Cold Calling

## What is LeadIQ Pro?

LeadIQ Pro is a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) software designed specifically for marketing agencies and sales teams who make cold calls to local businesses like dentists, lawyers, restaurants, etc.

**The Big Problem:** Right now, salespeople waste 5-10 minutes researching EVERY lead before calling them. For 1,000 leads, that's 83+ hours of manual work!

**Our Solution:** We do all that research automatically and show it instantly when you're ready to call.

## How It Works (Simple Version)

1. **Import your leads** (upload a spreadsheet or scrape from Google Maps)
2. **We research everything automatically** (website quality, reviews, competitors, etc.)
3. **Call directly from the app** while seeing all the research
4. **AI takes notes** and schedules follow-ups automatically

**Result:** What used to take 10 minutes per lead now takes 30 seconds.
